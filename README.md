Only a handful of humans understand RGB, CMYK, and HEX.
We built a color picker for everybody else.

## Examples

### Green Room
Colorplane was created for Green Room, a private group chat tool we built to share with our friends. Instead of avatars, users are represented only by a color. [green.33cc77.com](http://green.33cc77.com)

### Svbtle
Writers on Svbtle choose a color to represent their profile. In the past, writers had only a text field where they could input a HEX code. Now the writers can use a Colorplane to find just the right color. [svbtle.com](http://svbtle.com)
